### Your Must-Read: computer science, IT & programming books

#### Java

- [x] **The Well-Grounded Java Developer**, Benjamin J. Evans, Martijn Verburg, Manning, 2010
- [x] **Java in a Nutshell. A Desktop Quick Reference 7th Edition**, Ben Evans, David Flanagan, O'Reilly, 2018
- [x] **Thinking in Java 4th Edition**, Bruce Eckel, Pearson, 2006
- [x] **Spock Up and Running. Writing Expressive Tests in Java and Groovy**, Rob Fletcher, O'Reilly, 2017
- [x] **Java Testing With Spock**, Konstantinos Kapelonis, Manning, 2016

#### Security & Privacy

- [x] **Podstawy kryptografii**, Marcin Karbowski, Helion, 2014

*Eng. Cryptography Basics* - a pleasant introduction into cryptography basics. Topics of various difficulty, from beginner how-to-start and history to more advanced math formulas.
If this book was updated now and edited in English (and maybe extended in some areas), it would be a bestseller.



#### Computer science

- [x] **Informatyka. Wirtualna podróż w świat systemów i sieci komputerowych**, Mirosław Hajder, Heorhii Loutski, Wiesław Stręciwilk, 2002**

*Eng. Computer science. Virtual journey into the universe of networking and computer systems*. It is still an up-to-date knowledge source for computer programmers.
Some chapters are very easy, some others contain a lot of mathematics, formulas and computer science theory. 
Overall, a nice introduction into several areas of computer science.

### Still-To-Read List

I think I read a lot: some 5-6 books monthly, including an average 1,5 of IT book per month. 
But this to-read list grows even faster that I can manage.
Most of them - old school, but still worth reading.
