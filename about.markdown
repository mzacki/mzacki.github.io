### Toolkit & work environment

- languages

Java, Python, Groovy. Basic level SQL.
Plan to learn Scala or some low-level language.

- testing

Groovy & Spock (UT, IT, E2E). Cucumber & Gherkin for BDD. 
Thinking about Python. Preferably not JUnit.

- OS

Linux et consortes. MacOS if I have to. No Windows, please.

- VCS & repo

Love Git and GitHub. Bitbucket is also fine.
