### Reasons to use Spock

- [x] a few hours to learn and implement Spock tests to business grade applications
- [x] extremely easy to create test, add test cases, refactor, extend
- [x] quick execution of test suites
- [x] lightweight
- [x] applicable to unit tests, IT, E2E, BDD

### More advantages

- [x] gives clear details where test fails
- [x] readible methods naming (natural language description)
- [x] readible given / when / then blocks, often with English didascalia (BDD)
- [x] can be used along with Java jUnit, Python, Cucumber / Gherkin within the same project

### Characteristics

- [x] testing framework 
- [x] runs on JUnit runner
- [x] can mock and stub - like Mockito - but it's included
- [x] embraces the paradigm of behavior-driven development (BDD)
- [x] given / when / then declarative style of BDD
- [x] no assert statemets, no assert methods required (but can use assert keyword -> Groovy truth)
- [x] see https://meetspock.appspot.com/
- [x] see https://groovyconsole.appspot.com/
- [x] Spock is Groovy language testing Java code
- [x] but the reverse is possible: JUnit Java testing Groovy code , JUnit Groovy (sic!) testing Groovy OR Java code
- [x] Groovy supports a GroovyTestCase class, which extends the standard TestCase from JUnit

### Requirements

- [x] space to be created in the classpath (groovy test directory tree in project structure hierarchy)
- [x] directory marked as Test Sources Root in Intellij IDEA
- [x] Groovy & Spock dependency to be added to Maven, compatible with JDK / Spring version
- [x] configured Maven Failsafe or Surefire plugin to run Spock tests (specifications) during Maven build (mvn clean install)
- [x] sometimes configuration of CI / CD infrastructure (like Jenkins or Bamboo) is needed to run Spock Specs during build / deployment 
accordingly to project requirements

### Conclusions

- [x] fits business-level applications (also corporate, industry, everything...)
- [x] no overhead, easy to learn, implement and use
- [x] unit testing: imho best existing solution
- [x] IT, E2E, BDD: interesting & promising alternative to other options
- [x] modern technology, low risk of technical debt
