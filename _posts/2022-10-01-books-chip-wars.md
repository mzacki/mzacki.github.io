A couple of interesting books on technology. And geopolitics...

Chip War's author Chris Miller tells history of rivalry in electronic industry between US and Asian countries since WWII until today. 
A fascinating and up-to-date picture of global connections and dependencies in chip production sector that affect every economy all over the world.
And yes, it concerns Europe as well.

Intel CEO Andy Grove wrote a well-known, old school book about rise and fall and re-rise of his company: how to prepare for the worst, how to make your business (and professional career) resistant to economical and political winds.
I think every programmer should read it, especially while AI that can replace human employees is knocking at our doors. If you liked Nassim Taleb way of thinking and his *The Black Swan*, *Antifragile* and other books, it is more business detailed 
and IT-oriented stuff.
