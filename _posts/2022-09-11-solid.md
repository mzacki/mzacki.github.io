Author of the SOLID principle: Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin

**[S]** Single responsibility principle (SRP)

Each object should do one thing, and one thing only. (If something is for everything, it's good for nothing).

**[O]** Open / closed principle (OCP)

Objects should be extensible but not modifiable.

**[L]** Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes.

**[I]** Interface segregation principle (ISP)

Small specific interfaces are better.

**[D]** Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

Don't depend on concrete implementations.
