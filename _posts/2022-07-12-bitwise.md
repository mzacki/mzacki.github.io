### Bitwise essentials

- bitwise perform operations on individual bits of values
- used for testing and setting of individual bit flags in values
- if any of arguments is long, the result is long
- otherwise, the result is int

### Bitwise complement (NOT) (~)

What is it: operator

Type: unary

Looks like: ~

A.k.a. bitwise complement, NOT

Numbers of operands: 1

Action: inverts each byte of operand, converts 1 to 0 and _vice versa_

Name in logic: negation

```
byte b = ~15

~00001111
----------
 11110000
 
 result in 2's complement decimal: -16

```

Bitwise complement can be done on flags (to be continued).
