#### Must - read: computer science, IT & programming books I read (sometimes twice or more)

*In English*

**Java in a Nutshell. A Desktop Quick Reference 7th Edition, Ben Evans, David Flanagan, O'Reilly, 2018**

**Thinking in Java 4th Edition, Bruce Eckel, Pearson, 2006**

**Spock Up and Running. Writing Expressive Tests in Java and Groovy, Rob Fletcher, O'Reilly, 2017**

**Java Testing With Spock, Konstantinos Kapelonis, Manning, 2016**

*In Polish*

**Podstawy kryptografii, Marcin Karbowski, Helion, 2014**

A pleasant introduction into cryptography basics. Topics of various difficulty, from beginner how-to-start and history to more advanced math formulas.
If this book was updated now and edited in English (and maybe extended in some areas), it would be a bestseller.

**Informatyka. Wirtualna podróż w świat systemów i sieci komputerowych, Mirosław Hajder, Heorhii Loutski, Wiesław Stręciwilk, 2002**

It is still an up-to-date knowledge source for computer programmers.
Some chapters are very easy, some others contain a lot of mathematics, formulas and computer science theory. 
Overall, a nice introduction into several areas of computer science.

*Still to read (most of them - old school, but still worth reading)*

    I think I read a lot: some 5-6 books monthly, including an average 1,5 of IT book per month. But this to-read list grows even faster that I can manage.
